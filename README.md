# Brewtegrity®
### Brewtegrity® Tenets 
- No Antifoam Agents 
- Full Disclosure of all Process Agents and Ingredients 
- No Enzymes or Stabilizers 
- No Yeast Washing

There are certain processes that are currently obscured in the modern beer brewing process and there is consumer demand to understand completely what ingredients, agents, and processes go into the products they consume.  Utilizing the integrity and immutability of blockchain technology the Brewtegrity® Token (BT) gives the beer consumer a trustworthy view into all of the relevant information about the entire production process that delivers their beer.  This data can also extend to the entire supply chain process and enable a trustful market transparency model that will enhance efficiencies and reduce risk along the entire chain.

The Brewtegrity® Token will showcase all of the emergent properties of the Cardano ADA blockchain project.  A decentralized system to contain the management of relationships of all of the participants utilizing economic bounds to establish a Nash-equilibrium that allows for a trustful governance model to protect the integrity of the Brewtegrity® principles.  Smart Contracts can be utilized to convey value, trustworthy data, and programmatically evaluated relationship management. Tokens can be utilized to track supply chain data and consumer confidence information.  Liquid Democracy with an auditable Treasury allow for the decentralization of the governance of the protocol to prevent corruption of the core concept by dishonest parties (eg. the gradual weakening of the term “organic”).
