# Brewtegrity®
### Brewtegrity® Tenets 
- No Antifoam Agents 
- Full Disclosure of all Process Agents and Ingredients 
- No Enzymes or Stabilizers 
- No Yeast Washing

### Introduction 

There are certain processes that are currently obscured in the modern beer brewing process and there is consumer demand to understand completely what ingredients, agents, and processes go into the products they consume.  Utilizing the integrity and immutability of blockchain technology the Brewtegrity® Token (BT) gives the beer consumer a trustworthy view into all of the relevant information about the entire production process that delivers their beer.  This data can also extend to the entire supply chain process and enable a trustful market transparency model that will enhance efficiencies and reduce risk along the entire chain.

The Brewtegrity® Token will showcase all of the emergent properties of the Cardano ADA blockchain project.  A decentralized system to contain the management of relationships of all of the participants utilizing economic bounds to establish a Nash-equilibrium that allows for a trustful governance model to protect the integrity of the Brewtegrity® principles.  Smart Contracts can be utilized to convey value, trustworthy data, and programmatically evaluated relationship management. Tokens can be utilized to track supply chain data and consumer confidence information.  Liquid Democracy with an auditable Treasury allows for the decentralization of the governance of the protocol to prevent corruption of the core concept by dishonest parties (eg. the gradual weakening of the term “organic”). 

#### Consumer Experience

The consumer can use a simple web based app (block explorer) to scan a barcode printed on each bottle of beer.  This unique ID for each beer will have embedded information about everything that went into the beer.  From the location the hops were grown, to which farm the grains came from, to which brewer stirred the kettle, to how the water was specifically filtered.  All of the information that a brewery chooses to embed can be included in a permanent and infallible manner. Consumers can then register using a private key once they have actually consumed the beer to prove real world validity. 

Brewtegrity® Tokens are not used to buy beer at the consumer level, they contain the smart contracts and production data for each unit. They act purely as a utility token and not a security.
Consumers can use any cryptocurrency, to purchase the beer, that can interact with the Cardano blockchain.
Consumers can rate the trustworthiness and quality of the brewery and production process upon consumption. 
Consumers can have access to real world market data about the product they are consuming.
Consumers can be rewarded for brand loyalty when they elect to publish their consumer data (opt-in only consumer data).
Age validation integration dependent upon Cardano implementing secure personas in some novel way. 

#### Participation
To participate in the program breweries and supply chain participants purchase Brewtegrity® Tokens at a market/community determined cost using ADA, interacting with a centralized Smart Contract that manages supply and establishes community parameters.

Each batch of beer will be registered on the blockchain and issued Brewtegrity® Tokens to match the number of batches/kegs/bottles/cans/glasses produced.  

Batch tokens are divisible into keg tokens are divisible into bottle/can/glass tokens.
Wallet integration will allow breweries to easily and efficiently include accurate and timely information upon purchase/creation of the tokens. 

Supply chain participants can delegate tokens to the brewery to include in the batch token. 
The ADA used to purchase the Brewtegrity® Tokens can be used to maintain a Smart Contract that pays the transaction costs to provide the information and maintain the contracts between the consumer and supply chain stakeholders.  
Brewtegrity® Tokens are printed onto labels by which the consumer can be provided with a private key to validate their purchase/consumption. 

#### Governance
Utilizing the Liquid Democracy model available in Cardano paired with the treasury model, we can allow the governance of Brewtegrity® to be fully controlled by the stakeholders.

Goals of governance are to ensure participants are honest and trustworthy and enforce penalties for bad actors breaking the tenets of Brewtegrity® including enforcement of fines, suspension or exile.  
Treasury can be utilized to develop the platform and perform required maintenance. Treasury can also be utilized to reward honest market participation, reward consumer participation, and enforce positive behavior by any material stakeholder action.  

Governance is not intended to act as a dispute arbitration protocol for general business conflicts.  Established jurisdictional law and arbitration should be evaluated externally to the protocol and should not bias the fundamental purpose of protecting the core tenets of Brewtegrity®.  

A bootstrapping process will be required to onboard breweries, supply chain participants and educate market participation in the startup phase.  Careful initial market analysis and parameterization will be key in discovering the Nash-equilibrium state of the token.

#### Brewery Registration
Brewtegrity® Registration status is required to purchase Brewtegrity® Tokens
To get registered as a Brewtegrity® enabled Brewery requires a fee that is paid into a treasury to support the organization.    

Strict standards are set and agreed to and must be met with 100% fidelity to maintain registration.
Bad actors are punished by fines, suspension or loss of Brewtegrity® status as determined by stakeholder determined feedback mechanisms.
- Annual dues can be implemented to maintain registration.
- Set by market/community consensus
- Supply Chain Registration

All participants in the entire supply chain can register and validate their own information by purchasing Brewtegrity® - Tokens and sending them to the batch Smart Contract.
- Supply chain participants can receive bonus payments based on consumer actions.
- Supply chain participants can have transparent consumer information by participating. 

#### Data Inclusion
All relevant material factors can be included in the data including but not limited to plant matter, water, electricity, equipment, filtering, processing agents, additives, human actors, transportation, ownership chain, location information, environmental factors, humanitarian factors, earnings transparency, consumer ratings, trust data.

#### Smart Contracts
Smart Contracts enable a payment chain that could spread the business risk more evenly and transparently along the supply chain.  For example when the consumer pays to purchase one unit every supplier registered in the contract gets a portion of the purchase price.  Therefore the brewery doesn’t have to carry the risk of the hops, grain, water, brewer salary, etc.  Every stakeholder gets paid concurrently.  

Market Data Contracts also allow all stakeholders to have a public view of market data.  This data can be fully public or fully private dependant upon market privacy and security demands. 

Supply Chain Relationships and Contracts can be maintained together with sales data in one unified programmatically evaluated system to ensure decentralized trust amongst all of the participants.

If smart contracts are utilized to convey economic value between participants; external real world concerns are entirely the responsibility of the acting participants and not the concern of the Brewtegrity® platform. This would include any belief systems, legal liabilities, tax liabilities, external contract liabilities, or any other real world factors that may influence the agreements made by the participants.  

Consumer Satisfaction Data can be bound to sales data in a secure manner.  For example a rating system that is only available to the consumer through a private key that is consumed upon actual consumption of the product.  This can also be done in an Opt-In only manner.

#### Token Standard
It is useful to use Ethereum Classic ERC20 or ERC721 as the test platform and initial launching standard as it is an established and stabilized Smart Contract platform and protocol, however Cardano will be the superior platform to establish the Brewtegrity® Token on in the long run.  It will be reasonable to port the tokens from the Ethereum Classic blockchain over to Cardano as it develops in the future.  Cardano enables a decentralized governance model that can be implemented once the project achieves market stability. 

#### Scaling Model
This concept can logically and stably scale from one brewery conveying production data to one consumer to an entire market ecosystem managing and accounting for the entire production process from core production constituency to consumer.

- Phase 1 - First brewery utilizes token to convey information to consumer. 
- Phase 2 - First brewery utilizes token to track customer confidence.
- Phase 3 - First production member utilizes token to interact with brewery.
- Phase 4 - First production member utilizes token to interact with consumer.
- Phase 5 - Governance becomes fully decentralized.
- Phase 6 - Concept is applied to other markets.

#### Bad Actors
##### Slander Campaign
- Defined by creating false reviews to sway opinion and impose sanctions. 
- Requires purchasing large amounts of the product to enact votes.  Costly campaign.
- Mitigated by consumer awareness.

##### Falsifying Claims in production. Breaking tenets of Brewtegrity®
- Defined by supply chain fraud or misrepresentation of information.. 
- Caused by producers misreporting facts about process, ingredients, material information of any kind.
- Mitigated by consumer auditing. 
- Consequences of reveal include fines, suspension and exile to bad actors.

##### Lobbying Risk
- Defined by bad actors influencing a large enough stake to bias rules to prefer their method of production or obscure bad behavior. 
- Mitigated by consumer awareness and transparency of reporting.  The consumer will not allow the change.  
- Note: Beer consumers can have voting rights. This could include liquor distributors, liquor stores, bars,restaurants, and events as well as end consumers. 

##### Counterfeiting - Key Duplication
- Defined by an attempt to duplicate or steal the barcode hijacking the private key. 
- Mitigated by the security of the blockchain and by tamper resistant packaging/labeling.
